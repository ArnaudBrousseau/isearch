I-SEARCH
===

Welcome, this is an I-SEARCH (strange apple-like acronym meaning *A unIfied framework for multimodal SEARCH*) repo.
This space is used to build the GUI part of I-SEARCH.

Some info: 

- the mockup is built on top of the amazing HTML5BoilerPlate
- the build/ test/ crossdomain.xml robots.txt and plugin stub are here for the near future.
  We'll probably need it very soon. But if you ask: yes, they're unuseful right
  now.
- TODO: change the favicon (oh...I see a debate emerging here!)

Important note: when downloaded (e.g, on your desktop), you must add the
location to the "trusted locations" to make the Flash object behave properly.
You can do that by right-clicking on a Flash animation/movie/panel, then "Global Settings", then select
the "Advanced" tab. Under "Developer Tools" section, you'll find "Trusted Location Settings". 
This will give you the possibility to add a folder of your computer as
"trusted".

Have fun!
