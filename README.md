I-SEARCH
===

Welcome, this is an I-SEARCH (strange apple-like acronym meaning *A unIfied framework for multimodal SEARCH*) repo.
This space is used to build the GUI part of I-SEARCH.

Some info: 

- the mockup is built on top of the amazing HTML5BoilerPlate
- the build/ test/ crossdomain.xml robots.txt and plugin stub are here for the near future.
  We'll probably need it very soon. But if you ask: yes, they're unuseful right
  now.
- TODO: change the favicon (oh...I see a debate emerging here!)

Have fun!
